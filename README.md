# Vivify Quest Port
------
## Instructions for building the project yourself
(You can build your own .qmod, just make sure to give credit if distributing)

## Requirements for build
* [Quest Package Manager](https://github.com/sc2ad/QuestPackageManager) (QPM)

### To build:
```
qpm restore
qpm s build
qpm s qmod
```

If you have QPM installed but throws an error, use `.\qpm` instead

## Installation

*For the best experience, mod your game using [ModsBeforeFriday](https://mbf.bsquest.xyz/) on version 1.40.8*

*A [tutorial](https://bsmg.wiki/quest/modding-with-mbf.html) by the Beat Saber Modding Group (BSMG)'s wiki for those who are new to this*
### Through ModsBeforeFriday (MBF)
1. Download the latest `vivify.qmod` file from the **Releases** tab, or build it yourself as shown above.
2. Once your headset is modded, connect it to your computer and drag and drop `vivify.qmod` into MBF.
3. Alternatively, click the **ADD FILES** button and select the `.qmod` file.
4. Safely disconnect your headset, then launch Beat Saber.
